SeBa is a package of semi-analytical formulae which covers all phases of evolution from the zero-age main-sequence up to and including remnant phases.
It is valid for masses in the range 0.01-1000 Msun with variable metallicity.
SeBa includes prescriptions for mass loss by stellar winds, supernova and supports binary evolution.
